## Trigger the recording

There are many ways to trigger the blackbox record, here we simply show you the mostly common used two ways.

* Triggered by receiver
* No trigger, record blackbox data automatically when power up

### Triggered by receiver

Betaflight can record blackbox when the FC was ARM. So you need to hook a serial receiver to one of the two UARTs, and set them up properly in betaflight configurator.
